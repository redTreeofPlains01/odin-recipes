    <h2>Korean Bulgogi</h2>
    <p>So I’ve done my best to “grow up” and whip this up myself. Now to be honest, nothing beats my mom’s cooking but this is a very close second.
        <br> The key here is to slice the meat as thin as possible. Throwing the steak in the freezer for 20-30 minutes helps with this process tremendously. That way, the thin cuts of meat can soak up the most epic marinade in just a few hours.
        <br> Once it’s done marinating, the hard part is over. Throw it onto a super hot cast iron skillet or grill pan and that smoky, sweet-savory charred bits of meat will simply put you over the edge.
        <br> Serve with rice and maybe a side of kimchi for a full meal. Or red leaf lettuce tacos also work perfectly here</p>

        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean red pepper paste)</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
        <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Wrap steak in plastic wrap, and place in the freezer for 30 minutes. Unwrap and slice across the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine pear, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger and gochujang. In a gallon size Ziploc bag, combine soy sauce mixture and steak; marinate for at least 2 hours to overnight, turning the bag occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a cast iron grill pan over medium-high heat.* Working in batches, add steak to the grill pan in a single layer and cook, flipping once, until charred and cooked through, about 2-3 minutes per side. Repeat with
            remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and steak.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, garnished with green onions and sesame seeds, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: *If you do not have a cast iron grill pan, you can also use a large cast iron skillet.</p>
